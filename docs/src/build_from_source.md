# Building TensorFlow from source

Building TensorFlow from source is recommended by Google for maximum performance, especially when running in CPU mode - on some systems, the difference can be substantial. It will also be required for Mac OS X GPU support for TensorFlow versions later than 1.1. This document describes how to do so.


## Step 1: Build libtensorflow

To build libtensorflow for TensorFlow.jl, follow the [official instructions for building tensorFLow from source](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources), except for a few minor modifications so as to build the library rather than the client.

  * In the step "Prepare environment", ignore "Install python dependencies" -- these are not necessary as we are not building for Python. Be sure to follow all other steps as needed for your OS.
  * In the step "Build the pip package", since we are building the binary file and not the pip package, instead run `bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow:libtensorflow.so`, adding `--config=cuda` if GPU support is desired.

Running `bazel build` will produce the `libtensorflow.so` binary needed by TensorFlow.jl - there is no need to build the Python package or run anything else. You may place the binary wherever is convenient.


## Step 2: Install the TensorFlow binary

We must now tell TensorFlow.jl to load the custom binary. There are a number of ways to do so.

  * The simplest way is to copy `libtensorflow.so` to `~/.julia/v0.?/TensorFlow/deps/usr/bin/`, overwriting the included binary. If on Mac OS X, you may need to rename the file to `libtensorflow.dylib`.

  * Alternatively, for users who wish to keep their `libtensorflow.so` file elsewhere, or those who do not wish to modify their `TensorFlow.jl` installation, we can set the environment variable `LIBTENSORFLOW` to `/path/to/tensorflow.so`. This may be done system-wide by editing `.profile` or any other method supported by your OS.

  * For users of the Atom/Juno IDE who do not wish to modify their system-wide environment, environment variables may be set by adding the line `process.env.LIBTENSORFLOW = "/path/to/libtensorflow.so"` to the `init.coffee` script (easily accessible by clicking `File -> Init Script`). Note that Atom may not always inherit environment variables set by the OS.



## Step 3: Check that the custom binary is loaded

After running `using TensorFlow`, it should no longer complain that TensorFlow wasn't compiled with the necessary instructions. Try generating two random matrices and multiplying them together. You can time the computation with `@time run(sess, x)`, which should be much faster.


## Tips & known issues

  * For maximum performance, you should always compile on the same system that will be running the computation, and with the correct CUDA Compute Capability version supported by your GPU.

  * If TensorFlow.jl fails to load with the error `Library not loaded: @rpath/libcublas.8.0.dylib` or any similar error, it means that the CUDA libraries are not in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as required by Nvidia. Be sure to add `/usr/local/cuda/lib`, or wherever your CUDA instalation is located, to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This may be done by editing `.profile`, or for Atom/Juno users editing `init.coffee`, or any other method supported by your OS, as described in Step 2. Be careful that you append this folder and do not mistakenly overwrite your entire path.

  * If you get `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED`, then for some reason TensorFlow cannot find your GPU. Make sure that the appropriate software is installed, and if using an external GPU, make sure it is plugged in correctly.

  * To check whether the GPU is being used, create your session with `TensorFlow.Session(config=TensorFlow.tensorflow.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=true))`. TensorFlow will then print information about which device is used.

  * You may need to add symlinks from `libcudnn5.dylib` to `libcudnn.5.dylib` so that Bazel is able to correctly locate the necessary dependencies.

  * On Mac OS X, `nvcc`, Nvidia's CUDA compiler, requires OS X Command Line Tools version 8.2 and does not work with the latest version. You can download this version from Apple's website, and switch to it by running `sudo xcode-select -s /path/to/CommandLineTools`.

  * On Mac OS X, make sure to set the environment variable `GCC_HOST_COMPILER_PATH` to `/usr/bin/gcc` - do not install GCC yourself, or the build may fail with obscure error messages.

  * On Mac OS X, if you don't wish to install Homebrew, you can instead use Julia's internal Homebrew-based dependency manager Homebrew.jl by running ```Homebrew.brew(`install --build-from-source libtensorflow`)```. GPU support can be enabled by modifying the Ruby formula using ```Homebrew.brew(`edit libtensorflow`)``` -- you should set all necessary environment variables in the Ruby formula, as Homebrew may not display prompts correctly.
